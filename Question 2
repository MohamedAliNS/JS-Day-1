Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?
Http 1.1:
Http 1.1 released in 1997.
Http 1.1 communicate in plain text format between client request and server response.
Http 1.1, client never receives response resources from web server in a single time. 
It takes many requests and responses between client and server to get whole content displayed in web browser.
Multiple data cannot be pass each other due to same destination. So request at the head of queue cannot retrive its resource and block resources behind it. 
Multiple time tcp connections established to transfer data between client and server.

Http 2:
Http 2 released in 2015.
Top browsers such as chrome, safari, internet explorer supported this standardzation effort.
Data encapsulated by using binary framing layer in all requests and responses in binary format.
It decrease web page load latency by techniques such as multiplexing, compression, prioritization.
Binary framing layer transfer data by segmenting into smaller packets.
Single tcp connection established to transfer data between client and server.
Multiplexing resolves head of line blocking by concurrent messages. Thus it makes efficient method of transfering data.
Data is priortised based on weight in stream prioritization.
