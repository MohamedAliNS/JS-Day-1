Objects:
A Javascript object is a collection of named values. It is an user defined complex data type.

    name: "Raja",
    college: "Anna University",
    department: "CSE",
    id: 20221001,
}
console.log(student);
Output:
{
  name: 'Raja',
  college: 'Anna University',
  department: 'CSE',
  id: 20221001
}
